# Christmas-Tie
An Arduino and NeoPixel powered tie ....
OK - so the big challenge in any 'maker' related hobby is a good application.
Most of my projects start out learning a new piece of hardware - in this case it's the WS2812B Intelligent control LED's.

The setup and use went quick, lots of info and sample code out there on these LED strings. After a lot of code I discovered a way to create some great light shows - but the big question is "how to share the fun?"

The result is the "Christmas Tie"

Items needed for this project :

    Arduino mini (make sure you buy the 5 VDC version)
    a small string of the WS2812B LED's - I used 15
    a 5 VDC battery pack - I found a cheap $8, 2600mAh, a full charge will run the Tie all day.
    a standard USB cable.
    A cool Tie - I used a dark silk Christmas tie, the lights seem to shine through just at the right intensity.
    
SO you don't wear ties, well these lights can get real bright, so it's possible the light would shine through almost any seasonal clothing - like that crazy Christmas Sweater

I have some pictures on a 'sway' page https://sway.com/OW7bDocmCxhg

Getting the LED's into or onto clothing is the real trick. I used thread and a needle to secure the LED's to the inside of the tie. This method is not real secure but a neck tie doesn't get any abuse, so the soldered connections don't see any stress, so far so good.
